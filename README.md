## Features
- Phong lighting
- Height maps generated by perlin noise
- Biomes determined by elevation
- Low poly, smooth, and mesh modes
- Linear, exponential, and exponential squared fog shading

## Controls
- `command` + `Q` to exit application
- `esc` to capture mouse from application
- `shift` + `esc` to release into application
- `F` + `0` to enable linear fog shading
- `F` + `1` to enable exponential fog shading
- `F` + `2` to enable exponential squared fog shading
- `shift` + `F`to disable all fog shading
