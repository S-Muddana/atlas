# Atlas
Atlas is an OpenGL procedural randomly generated terrain generation application that implements perlin noise height maps, view frustum culling, and instancing.


## Features
- Phong lighting
- Randomly generated height maps generated by perlin noise
- Biomes determined by elevation
- Low poly, smooth, and mesh modes
- Linear, exponential, and exponential squared fog shading

## Controls
- `command/shift` + `Q` to exit application
- `esc` to capture mouse from application
- `shift` + `esc` to release into application
- `M` to enable wireframe
- `shift` + `M` to disable wireframe
- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move camera forward, left, back, and right
- `space`, `caps lock` to move camera up, down
- `F` + `0` to enable linear fog shading
- `F` + `1` to enable exponential fog shading
- `F` + `2` to enable exponential squared fog shading
- `shift` + `F`to disable all fog shading
- `G` to enable flat shading
- `shift` + `G` to disable flat shading
